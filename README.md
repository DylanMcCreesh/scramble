# scramble
Scramble is a iOS app project which aims to create a fresh take on the popular 
Wordle game! Guesses are of the form of a string of 5 symbols, from a set of 6.
However, after each guess, the player is provided with feedback only on (1) the 
number of symbols in the correct position and (2) the number of symbols which are 
in the key, but in the wrong position.

Scramble keeps track of the player's "streak" of successful games, and may in the 
future implement different difficulty levels.
